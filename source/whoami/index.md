Hi, my name is Karan Bhayani. I recently graduated with Bachelor's of Technology in IT and MBA-Tech in Business Intelligence & Analytics (if the name of this degree program didn't make sense, it's ok, I don't blame you).
I like cracking things open and understand them. Currently interested in offensive security and web application security. Apart from my diplomas I've few certifications: OSCP, CompTIA CySA+, and CompTIA Sec+.
